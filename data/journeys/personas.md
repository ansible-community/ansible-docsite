# Ansible community personas

Personas represent various humans who are all on different journeys within the Ansible community. These personas help put community users, or members, in context to identify what content they need at each stage of their respective journeys.

We use personas to ensure Ansible community users can find help when and where they need it. If the right support is there, users are much more likely to succeed with their goals. This leads to higher levels of adoption and a more vibrant, stronger community.

The practical goal of defining these personas is to improve the navigation and layout of the Ansible community website.
