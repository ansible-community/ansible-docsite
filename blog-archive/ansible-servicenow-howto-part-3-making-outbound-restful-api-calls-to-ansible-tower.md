# Ansible and ServiceNow Part 3, Making outbound RESTful API calls to Red Hat Ansible Tower

Red Hat Ansible Tower offers value by allowing automation to scale in a
checked manner - users can run playbooks for only the processes and
targets they need access to, and no further. 

Not only does Ansible Tower provide automation at scale, but it also
integrates with several external platforms. In many cases, this means
that users can use the interface they are accustomed to while launching
Ansible Tower templates in the background. 

One of the most ubiquitous self service platforms in use today is
ServiceNow, and many of the enterprise conversations had with Ansible
Tower customers focus on ServiceNow integration. With this in mind, this
blog entry walks through the steps to set up your ServiceNow instance to
make outbound RESTful API calls into Ansible Tower, using OAuth2
authentication.

The following software versions are used:

-   Ansible Tower: 3.4, 3.5
-   ServiceNow: London, Madrid

If you sign up for a ServiceNow Developer account, ServiceNow offers a
free instance that can be used for replicating and testing this
functionality. Your ServiceNow instance needs to be able to reach your
Ansible Tower instance. Additionally, you can visit
<https://ansible.com/license> to obtain a trial license for Ansible
Tower. Instructions for installing Ansible Tower can be found
[here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/quickinstall/prepare.html). 

## Preparing Ansible Tower

1. In Ansible Tower, navigate to **Applications** on the left side of
the screen. Click the **green plus button** on the right, which will
present you with a Create Application dialog screen. Fill in the
following fields:

-   Name: Descriptive name of the application that will contact Ansible Tower
-   Organization: The organization you wish this application to be a part of
-   Authorization Grant Type: Authorization code
-   Redirect URIS: `https://<snow_instance_id>.service-now.com/oauth_redirect.do`
-   Client Type: Confidential

    ![image3-4](/images/posts/archive/image3-4.png)

2. Click the green **Save** button on the right, at which point a
window will pop up, presenting you with the Client ID and Client Secret
needed for ServiceNow to make API calls into Ansible Tower. This will
only be presented **ONCE**, so capture these values for later use.

    ![image18](/images/posts/archive/image18.png)

3. Next, navigate to **Settings->System** on the left side of the
screen. You'll want to toggle the **Allow External Users to Create
Oauth2 Tokens** option to **on**. Click the green **Save** button to commit the change.

    ![image4-4](/images/posts/archive/image4-4.png)

## Preparing ServiceNow

1. Moving over to ServiceNow, Navigate to **System Definition->Certificates**.
This will take you to a screen of all the
certificates Service Now uses. Click on the **blue New button**, and
fill in these details:

-   Name: Descriptive name of the certificate
-   Format: PEM
-   Type: Trust Store Cert
-   PEM Certificate: The certificate to authenticate against Ansible
    Tower with. You can use the built-in certificate on your Tower
    server, located at `/etc/tower/tower.cert`. Copy the contents of this
    file into the field in ServiceNow.

    Click the **Submit** button at the bottom.

    ![image9-1](/images/posts/archive/image9-1.png)

2. In ServiceNow, Navigate to **System OAuth->Application Registry**.
This will take you to a screen of all the Applications ServiceNow
communicates with. Click on the **blue New button**, and you will be
asked What kind of Oauth application you want to set up. Select
**Connect to a third party Oauth Provider**.

    ![image20](/images/posts/archive/image20.png)

3. On the new application screen, fill in these details:

-   Name: Descriptive Application Name
-   Client ID: The Client ID you got from Ansible Tower
-   Client Secret: The Client Secret you got from Ansible Tower
-   Default Grant Type: Authorization Code
-   Authorization URL: `https://<tower_url>/api/o/authorize/`
-   Token URL: `https://<tower_url>/api/o/token/`
-   Redirect URL: `https://<snow_instance_id>.service-now.com/oauth_redirect.do`

    Click the **Submit** button at the bottom.

    ![image19](/images/posts/archive/image19.png)

4. You should be taken out to the list of all Application Registries.
Click back into the Application you just created. At the bottom, there
should be two tabs: Click on the tab **Oauth Entity Scopes**. Under
here, there is a section called **Insert a new row...**. Double click
here, and fill in the field to say Writing Scope. Click on the **green
check mark** to confirm this change. Then, right-click inside the grey
area at the top where it says Application Registries and click Save in
the menu that pops up.

    ![image11-1](/images/posts/archive/image11-1.png)

5. The writing scope should now be Clickable. Click on it, and in the
dialog window that you are taken to, type **write** in the Oauth scope
box. Click the Update button at the bottom.

    ![image7-1](/images/posts/archive/image7-1.png)

6. Back in the Application Settings page, scroll back to the bottom and
click the **Oauth Entity Profiles** tab. There should be an entity
profile populated - click into it.

    ![image21](/images/posts/archive/image21.png)

7.  You will be taken to the Oauth Entity Profile Window. At the
bottom, Type **Writing Scope** into the Oauth Entity Scope field. Click
the green check mark and update.

    ![image23](/images/posts/archive/image23.png)

8.  Navigate to **System Web Services -> REST Messages**. Click the
blue **New** button. In the resulting dialog window, fill in the
following fields:

-   Name: Descriptive REST Message Name
-   Endpoint: The url endpoint of the Ansible Tower action you wish to
    do. This can be taken from the browsable API at
    `https://<tower_url>/api`
-   Authentication Type: Oauth 2.0
-   Oauth Profile: Select the Oauth profile you created

    Right-click inside the grey area at the top; click **Save**.

    ![image10-1](/images/posts/archive/image10-1.png)

9.  Click the **Get Oauth Token** button on the REST Message screen.
This will generate a pop-up window asking to authorize ServiceNow
against your Ansible Tower instance/cluster. Click Authorize. ServiceNow will now have an OAuth2 token to authenticate against your Ansible Tower server.

    ![image22](/images/posts/archive/image22.png)

10.  Under the HTTP Methods section at the bottom, click the blue New button. At the new dialog window that appears, fill in the following fields:

-   HTTP Method: POST
-   Name: Descriptive HTTP Method Name
-   Endpoint: The url endpoint of the Ansible Tower action you wish to do. This can be taken from the browsable API at
    `https://<tower_url>/api`
-   HTTP Headers (under the HTTP Request tab)
    -   The only HTTP Header that should be required is *Content-Type: application/json*

You can kick off a RESTful call to Ansible Tower using these parameters
with the **Test** link.

![image6-3](/images/posts/archive/image6-3.png)

## Testing connectivity between ServiceNow and Ansible Tower

Clicking the **Test** link will take you to a results screen, which
should indicate that the Restful call was sent successfully to Ansible
Tower. In this example, ServiceNow kicks off an Ansible Tower job
Template, and the response includes the Job ID in Ansible Tower: 276.

![image eight](/images/posts/archive/image-88.png)

You can confirm that this Job Template was in fact started by going back
to Ansible Tower and clicking the **Jobs** section on the left side of
the screen; a Job with the same ID should be in the list (and, depending
on the playbook size, may still be in process):

## Creating a ServiceNow Catalog Item to Launch an Ansible Tower Job Template

Now that you are able to make outbound RESTful calls from
ServiceNow to Ansible Tower, it's time to create a catalog item for
users to select in ServiceNow in a production self-service fashion.
While in the HTTP Method options, click the **Preview Script Usage**
link:

![image nine](/images/posts/archive/image-99.png)

Copy the resulting script the appears, and paste it into a text editor
to reference later.

1.  In ServiceNow, navigate to **Workflow -> Workflow Editor.** This
will open a new tab with a list of all existing ServiceNow workflows.
Click on the blue **New Workflow** button:

    ![image16](/images/posts/archive/image16.png)

2.  In the **New Workflow** dialog box that appears, fill in the
following options:

-   Name: A descriptive name of the workflow
-   Table: Requested Item `sc_req_item`

    Everything else can be left alone. Click the **Submit** button.

    ![image1-10](/images/posts/archive/image1-10.png)

3. The resulting Workflow Editor will have only a Begin and End box.
Click on the line (it will turn blue to indicate it has been selected),
then press delete to get rid of it.

    ![image14-1](/images/posts/archive/image14-1.png)

4.  On the right side of the Workflow Editor Screen, select the Core
tab and, under Core Activities-\>Utilities, drag the Run Script option
into the Workflow Editor. In the new dialog box that appears, type in a
descriptive name, and paste in the script you captured from before.
Click Submit to save the Script.

    ![image12-1](/images/posts/archive/image12-1.png)

5.  Draw a connection from **Begin**, to the newly created Run Script
Box, and another from the **Run Script** box to **End**. Afterward,
click on the three horizontal lines to the left of the Workflow name,
and select the **Publish** option. You are now ready to associate this
workflow with a catalog item.

    ![image8-1](/images/posts/archive/image8-1.png)

6.  Navigate to **Service Catalog -> Catalog Definitions -> Maintain Items**. Click the blue **New** button on the resulting item list. In
the resulting dialog box, fill in the following fields:

-   Name: Descriptive name of the Catalog Item
-   Catalog: The catalog that this item should be a part of
-   Category: Required if you wish users to be able to search for this
    item

    In the Process Engine tab, populate the **Workflow** field with the Workflow you just created.
    Click the Submit Button.
    You've not created a new catalog item!

    ![image5-4](/images/posts/archive/image5-4.png)

7.  Lastly, to run this catalog item, navigate to
**Self-Service -> Homepage** and search for the catalog item you just
created. Once found, click the **order now** button. You can see the
results page pop up in ServiceNow, and you can confirm that the Job is
being run in Ansible Tower.

Congratulations! After completing these steps, you can now use a
ServiceNow Catalog Item to launch Job and Workflow Templates in Ansible
Tower. This is ideal for allowing end users to use a front end they are
familiar with in order to perform automated tasks of varying
complexities. This familiarity goes a long way toward reducing the time
to value for the enterprise as a whole, rather than just the teams
responsible for writing the playbooks being used.
