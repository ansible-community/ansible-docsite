# A Deeper Look: Red Hat Named a Leader in the Forrester Wave

This week, [we announced](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-named-leader-infrastructure-automation-industry-research-firm)
that Red Hat has been named a leader in The Forrester
Wave Infrastructure Automation, Q1 2023. In
an effort to help explain this result from our point of view, the
following blog answers some of the most frequently asked questions.
 
## What is The Forrester Wave?

"The Forrester Wave™ is a guide for buyers considering their purchasing
options in a technology marketplace and is based on our analysis and
opinion. To offer an equitable process for all participants, Forrester
follows a publicly available methodology, which we apply consistently
across all participating vendors [source](https://www.forrester.com/policies/forrester-wave-methodology/)] 

[Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/about-us/) has been a mainstay
throughout people's automation journeys, and Red Hat is proud to be
recognized as a leader in the results of this Q1 2023 report.


## What were the results?

Red Hat, specifically focused on Ansible Automation Platform, [has been named a leader](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-named-leader-infrastructure-automation-industry-research-firm) in the Q1, 2023 Forrester Wave™ Infrastructure Automation report. 

Refer to the following graphic, that can be viewed in the [final report](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/forrester-wave-infrastructure-automation-analyst-asset).

## Why is this significant to us?

We believe Forrester is one of the most recognized technology analyst
firms in the IT space, and that having received a leader ranking
furthers the narrative that Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is
driving value for organizations looking to make automation a strategic
part of their IT and OT estates. 

## How was The Forrester Wave judged? What criteria were used?

Forrester used a comprehensive method for administering the Wave with a
deliberate, phased approach that took place over many months. Using the
[Forrester Wave Methodology](https://www.forrester.com/policies/forrester-wave-methodology/),
the research team invites vendors to participate, hosts a preliminary
kickoff and planning meeting, provides evaluation criteria, submits
feedback in written and demo formats, and finally provides scoring and
feedback back to the vendor.

## Why were some popular automation solutions not included in the Wave?

Based on [The Forrester Wave Vendor Participation Policy](https://www.forrester.com/policies/wave-vendor-nonparticipation-policy/)
page, the vendor either did not qualify or did not meet inclusion
criteria to be considered. You'll notice that there were vendors that
did qualify and were invited but that they declined to participate
(noted with a gray circle on the graphic).
