# Managing a VMware Template Lifecycle with Ansible

When we manage a large number of virtual machines (VMs), we want to
reduce the differences between them and create a standard template. By
using a standard template, it becomes easier to manage and propagate the
same operation on the different nodes. When using VMware vSphere, it is
a common practice to share a standardized VM template and use it to
create new VMs. This template is often called a golden image. Its
creation involves a series of steps that can be automated with Ansible.
In this blog, we will see how one can create and use a new golden image.

# Prepare the golden image

![screenshot](/images/posts/archive/my-golden-image.png)

We use [image builder](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/composing_a_customized_rhel_system_image/composer-description_composing-a-customized-rhel-system-image#doc-wrapper)
to prepare a new image. The tool provides a user interface that allows
users to define custom images. In this example, we include the SSH
server and tmux. The result image is a file in the VMDK4 format that is
not totally supported by VMware vSphere 7, so this is the reason why we
use a `.vmdk-4` suffix.

We upload the image using the *uri* module. Uploading large files using
this method is rather slow. If you can,  you may want to drop the file
on the datastore directly (e.g: NFS/CIFS). The following example
considers that the datastore is called *rw_datastore* and the datacenter
name is *my_dc*. The following excerpt from the playbook shows how we
upload the image.

``` yml
- name: Upload from contents of remote file
  ansible.builtin.uri:
    force_basic_auth: true
    url: 'https://vcenter.test/folder/my-vmdk/my-golden-image.vmdk-4?dcPath=my_dc&dsName=rw_datastore'
    url_username: '{{ lookup("ansible.builtin.env", "VMWARE_USER") }}'
    url_password: '{{ lookup("ansible.builtin.env", "VMWARE_PASSWORD") }}'
    method: PUT
    status_code: 201
    src: my-golden-image.vmdk-4
    validate_certs: false
    follow_redirects: yes
```

Now that we've uploaded our file, we will convert it as an up to date
VMDK file. For this purpose, we use
[vmkfstools](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.storage.doc/GUID-A5D85C33-A510-4A3E-8FC7-93E6BA0A048F.html).
The tool is available on the ESXi7 hosts by default. In the task below,
we use delegate_to: esxi1.test to run the command on one of our hosts.

``` yml
- name: Convert the image in an up to date VMDK format
  ansible.builtin.command: "vmkfstools -i /vmfs/volumes/rw_datastore/my-vmdk/my-golden-image.vmdk-4.vmdk-4   /vmfs/volumes/rw_datastore/my-vmdk/my-golden-image.vmdk -d thin"
  delegate_to: esxi1.test
  vars:
      ansible_user: root
      ansible_python_interpreter: /bin/python3
```

# Preparing the golden VM

At this stage, the disk is ready and we can connect it to a VM.

``` yml
- name: Create a VM
  vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_vm:
    placement:
      cluster: ""
      datastore: ""
      folder: ""
      resource_pool: ""
    name: my-golden-vm
    guest_OS: RHEL_7_64
    hardware_version: VMX_11
    memory:
      hot_add_enabled: true
      size_MiB: 1024
    disks:
      - type: SATA
        backing:
          type: VMDK_FILE
          vmdk_file: "[rw_datastore] my-vmdk/my-golden-image.vmdk"
    cdroms:
      - type: SATA
        sata:
          bus: 0
          unit: 2
    nics:
      - backing:
          type: STANDARD_PORTGROUP
          network: ""
  register: my_vm
```

There are four different ways to clone a VM with Ansible's
[vmware.vmware_rest](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/vmware/vmware_rest) collection.
This article explains the difference between them and how to use them
with Ansible.

## Cloning the VM

When we clone a VM, we create a copy of the original. However, the
original can still evolve and a second clone from the same VM is likely
to be different. There is no guarantee that two clones will be based on
exactly the same image.

The `vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_vm` module allows us to prepare either
an instant clone or a regular clone.

### Instant clone

According to the [VMware official documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-853B1E2B-76CE-4240-A654-3806912820EB),
an instant clone is a lightweight copy of a live VM. It shares memory
blocks with the original VM. This is the reason why the original VM must
be running before we can clone it.

``` yml
- name: Turn the power on the VM on, since it's are pre-condition for Instant Clone
  vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_vm_power:
    state: start
    vm: '{{ my_vm.id }}'

- name: Wait until my VM is ready
  vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_vm_tools_info:
    vm: '{{ my_vm.id }}'
  register: vm_tools_info
  until:
  - vm_tools_info is not failed
  - vm_tools_info.value.run_state == "RUNNING"
  retries: 10
  delay: 5
```

Now we've got the VM up and running, we can instant clone it:

``` yml
- name: Create an instant clone of a VM
  vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_vm:
    placement:
      datastore: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.datastore_moid', '/my_dc/datastore/local') }}"
      folder: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.folder_moid', '/my_dc/vm') }}"
      resource_pool: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.resource_pool_moid', '/my_dc/host/my_cluster/Resources') }}"
    state: instant_clone
    source: "{{ my_vm.id }}"
    name: instant_clone_1
```

### Regular clone

We can also [clone an existing VM](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-1E185A80-0B97-4B46-A32B-3EF8F309BEED.html).
The operation takes more time, up to several hours, if the VM comes with
large disks. The operation creates a full clone of the original VM. This
time, the original VM doesn't need to be running.

``` yml
- name: Create a full clone of a VM
  vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_vm:
    placement:
      datastore: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.datastore_moid', '/my_dc/datastore/local') }}"
      folder: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.folder_moid', '/my_dc/vm') }}"
      resource_pool: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.resource_pool_moid', '/my_dc/host/my_cluster/Resources') }}"
    state: clone
    source: "{{ my_vm.id }}"
    name: full_clone_1
```

## Build a template

Unlike clone, a template gives us the guarantee that the VM inherits
from a static VM image. The vmware.vmware_rest collection gives us the
ability to prepare OVF packages, and since the 2.2.0 release, we can
also prepare a template VM.

## Export a VM as an OVF package on a content library

We can export a VM as an OVF package and upload the package into a
content library. This is handy if you want to prepare a standard
template that you will reuse on your vSphere infrastructure. Also, an
OVF package can be downloaded from one vSphere and be reuploaded in a
different one.

In this example, we use Ansible to prepare the OVF package. In this
example, *my_vm* is not running and the content library is called
*my_library_on_nfs*.

``` yml
- name: List all Local Content Library
  vmware.vmware_rest.content_locallibrary_info:
  register: all_content_libraries

- name: Use the name to identify the right Content Library
  set_fact:
    nfs_lib: "{{ all_content_libraries.value | selectattr('name', 'equalto', 'my_library_on_nfs')|first }}"

- name: Export the VM as an OVF on the library
  vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_ovf_libraryitem:
    session_timeout: 2900
    source:
      type: VirtualMachine
      id: "{{ my_vm.id }}"
    target:
      library_id: "{{ nfs_lib.id }}"
    create_spec:
      name: golden_image
      description: an OVF example
      flags: []
    state: present
```

![vsphere client screenshot](/images/posts/archive/vsphere-client-screenshot.png)

To spawn a new VM based on this OVF package, you need first to identify
its item entry on the content library.

``` yml
- name: Get the list of items of the NFS library
  vmware.vmware_rest.content_library_item_info:
    library_id: '{{ nfs_lib.id }}'
    register: lib_items
- name: Define a new fact with the golden image ID
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    golden_image_id: '{{ (lib_items.value|selectattr("name", "equalto", "golden_image")|first).id }}'
```

Once we've got the item ID, we can call `vcenter_ovf_libraryitem` to
spawn a new VM. Since the ID is immutable, we can save for a future use.

``` yml
- name: Create a new VM based on the OVF
  vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_ovf_libraryitem:
    ovf_library_item_id: '{{ golden_image_id }}'
    state: deploy
    target: resource_pool_id: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.resource_pool_moid', '/my_dc/host/my_cluster/Resources') }}"
    deployment_spec:
      name: my_vm_from_ovf
      accept_all_EULA: true
      storage_provisioning: thin
```

### Export a VM as a VM template on a content library

The template creation is done with one call of the
`vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_vmtemplate_libraryitems` module. This module
was introduced in the vmware_rest collection 2.2.0.

Here, `nfs_lib` is your content library and your VM details are
registered in the `my_vm` variable.

``` yml
- name: Create a VM template on the library
  vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_vmtemplate_libraryitems:
    name: golden-template
    library: "{{ nfs_lib.id }}"
    source_vm: "{{ my_vm.id }}"
    placement:
      cluster: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.cluster_moid', '/my_dc/host/my_cluster') }}"
      folder: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.folder_moid', '/my_dc/vm') }}"
      resource_pool: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.resource_pool_moid', '/my_dc/host/my_cluster/Resources') }}"
```

![vsphere client screenshot](/images/posts/archive/vsphere-client-screenshot-one.png)

To spawn a new VM based on this template, we once again need to identify
the item on the content library.

``` yml
- name: Get the list of items of the NFS library
  vmware.vmware_rest.content_library_item_info:
    library_id: '{{ nfs_lib.id }}'
  register: lib_items

- name: Use the name to identify the item
  set_fact:
    my_template_item: "{{ lib_items.value | selectattr('name', 'equalto', 'golden-template')|first }}"
```

We use the same module for the deployment:

``` yml
- name: Deploy a new VM based on the template
  vmware.vmware_rest.vcenter_vmtemplate_libraryitems:
    name: vm-from-template
    library: "{{ nfs_lib.id }}"
    template_library_item: "{{ my_template_item.id }}"
    placement:
      cluster: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.cluster_moid', '/my_dc/host/my_cluster') }}"
      folder: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.folder_moid', '/my_dc/vm') }}"
      resource_pool: "{{ lookup('vmware.vmware_rest.resource_pool_moid', '/my_dc/host/my_cluster/Resources') }}"
    state: deploy
```

In conclusion, in just a couple of Ansible tasks, we can promote an
existing VM as a Template. This allows us to rely on Ansible to automate
the maintenance of our VM Templates and ensure the reproducibility of
the process.
