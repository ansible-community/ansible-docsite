# Customer Spotlights at AnsibleFest 2020

AnsibleFest 2020 will be here before we know it, and we cannot wait to
connect with everyone in October. We have some great content lined up
for this year's virtual experience and that includes some amazing
customer spotlights. This year you will get to hear from CarMax, Blue
Cross Blue Shield of NC, T-Mobile, and Cepsa. These customers are using
Ansible in a variety of ways, and we hope you connect to their
incredible stories of teamwork and transformative automation.

**Customer Spotlights**

Benjamin Blizard, a Network Engineer at T-Mobile, will explore how
T-Mobile transformed from a disparate organization with difficulty
enforcing standards to a collaborative group of engineers working from
repeatable templates and processes. T-Mobile, a major telecommunications
provider, uses Ansible Automation Platform to standardize processes
across their organization. Ben will show how automation supports
T-Mobile's compliance standards, data integrity, and produces speed and
efficiency for network teams.Â 

Peter Bojovic, Director of Systems Engineering at Blue Cross Blue Shield
of North Carolina, will talk about how they used automation to drive
down costs in managed service costs while increasing productivity. Blue
Cross NC, a leading health insurance provider, recently implemented a
new tool to automate provisioning of their virtual machines for critical
on-premise applications.

Members of Blue Cross NC's deployment team will also speak on a panel
interview setup, featuring: Tobin Shay, Alex Devirgilis and Pavan
Mutyala. They will discuss their recent experiences using automation to
handle a large-scale migration and the future of automation at Blue
Cross NC. The interview will also touch on how a large organization
works to decrease a reliance on managed services, and the planning and
processes that lead to a projected 16-week project being completed in
just three business days.
