# Command Module Deep Dive for Networks

Enterprise customers often ask the Ansible Network team about the most
common use cases for network automation. For this blog post I want to
talk about one of the most used (and most versatile) set of network
modules: the `command` modules. The command modules let you run
networking commands with Ansible, the same way a network engineer would
type them on the command line. With Ansible, though, the output doesn't
just fly by the terminal window to be lost forever; it can be stored and
used in subsequent tasks. It can also be captured in variables, parsed
for use by other tasks, and stored in host variables for future
reference.
Today we're going to cover basic use of the network `command` modules,
including retaining command output with the `register` parameter. We'll
also cover scaling to multiple network devices with `hostvars` and
adding conditional requirements with the `wait_for` parameter and three
related parameters: `interval`, `retries`, and `match`. The takeaway
from this blog post is that any repeatable network operations task can
be automated. Ansible is more than configuration management, it allows
network operators the freedom to decouple themselves from routine tasks
and save themselves time.

There are command modules for a variety of platforms, including all the
modules [supported](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3184741) under
the network offering:

## Basic Command Module Usage

Here is a simple playbook using eos_command to run **show version**:

```yaml
---
- name: COMMAND MODULE PLAYBOOK
  hosts: eos
  connection: network_cli

  tasks:
   - name: EXECUTE ARISTA EOS COMMAND
     eos_command:
       commands: show version
     register: output

   - name: PRINT OUT THE OUTPUT VARIABLE
     debug:
       var: output
```

There are two tasks; the first task uses eos_command with a single
parameter called **commands**. Since I am only running one command I can
just type `show version` on the same line as commands. If I had more
than one command, I would list each one on a separate line below the
**commands**: parameter. In this example I use the [register
keyword](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#registered-variables)
to save the output of the show version command. You can use the
**register** parameter at the task level with any Ansible task. The
register parameter defines a variable to store the output of the task
for use in subsequent tasks. In my playbook the variable is called
**output**.

The second task uses the [debug
module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/debug_module.html)
to print out the content of the variable **output**, from the previous
task. In this case I will see the same output I would have seen if I'd
typed "show version" at the command line directly on the EOS device. My
playbook prints this output in the terminal window where I ran the
playbook. The Ansible [debug
module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/debug_module.html)
is great for checking variables.

Below is the output from running the playbook:

```bash
PLAY [eos] *************************************************************************

TASK [execute Arista eos command] **************************************************
ok: [eos]

TASK [print out the output variable] ***********************************************
ok: [eos] => {
    "output": {
        "changed": false,
        "failed": false,
        "stdout": [
            "Arista vEOS\nHardware version:    \nSerial number:       \nSystem MAC address:  0800.27ec.005e\n\nSoftware image version: 4.20.1F\nArchitecture:           i386\nInternal build version: 4.20.1F-6820520.4201F\nInternal build ID:      790a11e8-5aaf-4be7-a11a-e61795d05b91\n\nUptime:                 1 day, 3 hours and 23 minutes\nTotal memory:           2017324 kB\nFree memory:            1111848 kB"
        ],
        "stdout_lines": [
            [
                "Arista vEOS",
                "Hardware version:    ",
                "Serial number:       ",
                "System MAC address:  0800.27ec.005e",
                "",
                "Software image version: 4.20.1F",
                "Architecture:           i386",
                "Internal build version: 4.20.1F-6820520.4201F",
                "Internal build ID:      790a11e8-5aaf-4be7-a11a-e61795d05b91",
                "",
                "Uptime:                 1 day, 3 hours and 23 minutes",
                "Total memory:           2017324 kB",
                "Free memory:            1111848 kB"
            ]
        ]
    }
}

PLAY RECAP *************************************************************************
eos                        : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

You can see in the output above that both tasks were executed
successfully. The first task with the default verbosity has no output,
it simply returns the host the task was executed on, **eos**, with
**ok** and the color green to indicate success. The second task, using
the debug module, returns output from the command that was executed. You
see the same information in two different formats:

-   stdout
-   stdout_lines

The stdout returns everything a human operator would have seen on the
command line in one large string. The stdout_lines returns a list of
strings, making the information easier to read. Each item is a separate
line that was returned from the command.

Here is the output to see what that looks like:

**Arista EOS command line output**

```bash
eos>show vers
Arista vEOS
Hardware version:
Serial number:
System MAC address: 0800.27ec.005e
Software image version: 4.20.1F
Architecture: i386
Internal build version: 4.20.1F-6820520.4201F
Internal build ID: 790a11e8-5aaf-4be7-a11a-e61795d05b91
Uptime: 1 day, 3 hours and 56 minutes
Total memory: 2017324 kB
Free memory: 1116624 kB
```

**Ansible stdout_lines**

```bash
"stdout_lines": [
    [
          "Arista vEOS",
          "Hardware version:",
          "Serial number:",
          "System MAC address: 0800.27ec.005e",
          "",
          "Software image version: 4.20.1F",
          "Architecture: i386",
          "",
          "Internal build version: 4.20.1F-6820520.4201F",
          "Internal build ID: 790a11e8-5aaf-4be7-a11a-e61795d05b91",
          "",
          "Uptime: 1 day, 3 hours and 23 minutes",
          "Total memory: 2017324 kB",
          "Free memory: 1111848 kB"
        ]
```

Engineers and folks familiar with JSON and YAML have already noticed
another interesting detail: stdout_lines begins with two opening
brackets

```bash
"stdout_lines": [
            [
```

The two opening brackets show that stdout_lines actually returned a list
of lists of strings. If we modify our debug task slightly we use this
feature to view selections from the output. Since the output only has
one list within the list, that entire sub-list is referenced as list
zero, or the first list. Let's look at a single line from the return
value. I want to grab the **System MAC Address** for our test. Looking
above at the output, the **System MAC address** is returned in the
fourth line, which corresponds to line 3 (since computers start counting
from 0). This means we want to grab line 3 of list 0, which corresponds
to `output.stdout_lines[0][3]`.

```yaml
- name: print out a single line of the output variable
  debug:
  var: output.stdout_lines[0][3]
```

The debug task returns exactly what we need:

```bash
TASK [print out a single line of the output variable] ******************************
ok: [eos] => {
    "output.stdout_lines[0][3]": "System MAC address:  0800.27ec.005e"
}
```
Why would we want that first list to be zero and what is the use case
for having multiple lists? It is possible to run multiple commands with
one command task.Here is a playbook with three commands:

```yaml
---
- hosts: eos
  connection: network_cli
  tasks:
    - name: execute Arista eos command
      eos_command:
        commands:
          - show version
          - show ip int br
          - show int status
      register: output

    - name: print out command
      debug:
        var: output.stdout_lines
```

The output from output now looks like this:

```bash
"output.stdout_lines": [
    [
        "Arista vEOS",
        "Hardware version:    ",
        "Serial number:       ",
        "System MAC address:  0800.27ec.005e",
        "",
        "Software image version: 4.20.1F",
        "Architecture:           i386",
        "Internal build version: 4.20.1F-6820520.4201F",
        "Internal build ID:      790a11e8-5aaf-4be7-a11a-e61795d05b91",
        "",
        "Uptime:                 1 day, 4 hours and 20 minutes",
        "Total memory:           2017324 kB",
        "Free memory:            1111104 kB"
    ],
    [
        "Interface              IP Address        Status    Protocol      MTU",
        "Ethernet1              172.16.1.1/24      up         up          1500",
        "Management1            192.168.2.10/24    up         up          1500"
    ],
    [
        "Port  Name    Status       Vlan    Duplex  Speed  Type     Flags",
        "Et1           connected  routed    full    unconf EbraTestPhyPort   ",
        "Et2           connected    1       full    unconf EbraTestPhyPort   ",
        "Et3           connected    1       full    unconf EbraTestPhyPort   ",
        "Ma1           connected  routed   a-full a-1G   10/100/1000"
    ]
]
```

List zero corresponds to the `show version` command, list one corresponds
to the `show ip int br` command and list two corresponds to the `show int status` command.
The list number directly corresponds to the order the command was run in.

| **Arista EOS Command**  | **Relevant List**        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| `show version`          | `output.stdout_lines[0]` |
| `show ip int br`        | `output.stdout_lines[1]` |
| `show int status`       | `output.stdout_lines[2]` |

## Scaling Command Module Use: Host Variables

So what happens if we run on two or more network devices at the same time?

![diagram of Ansible running multiple network devices](/images/posts/archive/ansible-multiple-network-devices-run.png)

The variable output is saved uniquely as a [host
variable](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#magic-variables-and-how-to-access-information-about-other-hosts)
per inventory host.  If I had three switches and ran this playbook
against them, I would have an output variable for each unique host.  For
a demonstration we will grab the IP address from the `show ip int br`
command above for the Ethernet1 port for just one of the switches,
switch03.  The `show ip int br` corresponds to the second command we
run, and the ethernet1 interface shows up in the 2nd line so we know we
want `stdout_lines[1][1]`.  To reference vars about a specific host we
use the keyword **hostvars** and do a dictionary lookup on the host we
want.

This is what the debug task will look like:

```yaml
- name: debug hostvar
  debug:
    var: hostvars["switch03"].output.stdout_lines[1][1]
```

And the output matches what we would expect:

```bash
TASK [debug hostvar] ***************************************************************
ok: [switch03] => {
    "hostvars["switch03"].output.stdout_lines[1][1]": "Ethernet1              172.16.1.3/24      up         up              1500"
}
```

By default a task will use variables specific to that host, but when
using hostvars you can directly reference other host variables.

## Conditions in Command Module Tasks: wait_for

The `wait_for` parameter applies conditional logic directly after a
command is run. This means within the same task you can decide to
purposely fail if output does not match a desired state. By default,
with the above tasks, when there is no `wait_for` parameter specified
the task is only run one time. However, if the `wait_for` parameter is
specified the task is run until the condition is met or the maximum
retries (the default is 10 retries) is hit. If I turn on command logging
I can easily see this with a playbook specifically meant to fail for
demonstration purposes:

```yaml
---
- hosts: eos
  connection: network_cli
  tasks:
    - name: execute Arista eos command
      eos_command:
        commands:
          - show int status
        wait_for:
          - result[0] contains DURHAM
```

This playbook will run show int status 10 times, because it will never
find the word DURHAM in the output of show int status.

A `show logging` command shows me the command was indeed run 10 times:

```bash
Mar 24 20:33:52 eos Aaa: %ACCOUNTING-6-CMD: admin vty6 192.168.2.1 stop task_id=17 start_time=1521923632.5 timezone=UTC service=shell priv-lvl=15 cmd=show interfaces status

Mar 24 20:33:54 eos Aaa: %ACCOUNTING-6-CMD: admin vty6 192.168.2.1 stop task_id=19 start_time=1521923634.81 timezone=UTC service=shell priv-lvl=15 cmd=show interfaces status

Mar 24 20:33:56 eos Aaa: %ACCOUNTING-6-CMD: admin vty6 192.168.2.1 stop task_id=21 start_time=1521923636.99 timezone=UTC service=shell priv-lvl=15 cmd=show interfaces status
Mar 24 20:33:58 eos Aaa: %ACCOUNTING-6-CMD: admin vty6 192.168.2.1 stop task_id=22 start_time=1521923638.07 timezone=UTC service=shell priv-lvl=15 cmd=show interfaces status
Mar 24 20:33:59 eos Aaa: %ACCOUNTING-6-CMD: admin vty6 192.168.2.1 stop task_id=23 start_time=1521923639.22 timezone=UTC service=shell priv-lvl=15 cmd=show interfaces status
Mar 24 20:34:00 eos Aaa: %ACCOUNTING-6-CMD: admin vty6 192.168.2.1 stop task_id=24 start_time=1521923640.32 timezone=UTC service=shell priv-lvl=15 cmd=show interfaces status
Mar 24 20:34:01 eos Aaa: %ACCOUNTING-6-CMD: admin vty6 192.168.2.1 stop task_id=25 start_time=1521923641.4 timezone=UTC service=shell priv-lvl=15 cmd=show interfaces status
Mar 24 20:34:02 eos Aaa: %ACCOUNTING-6-CMD: admin vty6 192.168.2.1 stop task_id=26 start_time=1521923642.47 timezone=UTC service=shell priv-lvl=15 cmd=show interfaces status
```

Here we can look at a real world example. For this playbook everything
is configured to bring up an OSPF adjacency with another device, except
the `ip ospf area` command. We will apply the command and then use the
`wait_for` parameter to make sure the adjacency comes up (indicated by
FULL). If full is not found within 10 retries the task will fail.

```yaml
---
- hosts: eos
  connection: network_cli
  tasks:
    - name: turn on OSPF for interface Ethernet1
      eos_config:
        lines:
          - ip ospf area 0.0.0.0
        parents: interface Ethernet1

    - name: execute Arista eos command
      eos_command:
        commands:
          - show ip ospf neigh
        wait_for:
          - result[0] contains FULL
```

Execute the playbook with the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
➜  ansible-playbook ospf.yml

PLAY [eos] *********************************************************************************************

TASK [turn on OSPF for interface Ethernet1] *******************************************************
changed: [eos]

TASK [execute Arista eos command] ****************************************************************
ok: [eos]

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************************************
eos                    : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

Checking on the command line confirms the playbook ran successfully:

```bash
eos#show ip ospf neigh
Neighbor ID     VRF      Pri State             Dead Time   Address         Interface
2.2.2.2         default  1   FULL/DR           00:00:33    172.16.1.2      Ethernet1
```

In addition to `contains` we can use:

-   `eq`: Equal
-   `neq`: Not equal
-   `gt`: Greater than
-   `ge`: Greater than or equal
-   `lt`: Less than
-   `le` : Less than or equal

There are also three parameters that can be used in conjunction with
wait_for. All of these are documented on the individual module pages:

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| interval      | Time between each command retry                                    |
| retries       | The number of times we retry the task until we fail (or the condition is met) |
| match         | Match all of your conditionals or just any of them                 |

Let's quickly elaborate on the match parameter:

```yaml
- name: execute Arista eos command
  eos_command:
    commands:
      - show ip ospf neigh
    match: any
    wait_for:
      - result[0] contains FULL
      - result[0] contains 172.16.1.2
```

With `match: any` set, the task will succeed if the result contains
either FULL or 172.16.1.2. With `match: all` (which is the default),
both must be true before the task can successfully pass. It is far more
likely if you have multiple conditionals that you want them all met
versus just one of them to be true.

Looking for a use-case where you might want to use `match: any`? Imagine
that you want to confirm internet access to and from a datacenter. For
this particular data center you have five ISPs (Internet Service
Providers), and five discrete BGP connections between your data center
and those ISPs. An Ansible Playbook could check all five BGP connections
and continue on if **any** of them are up and working, rather than all
five. Just remember that **any** implies OR versus **all** which implies
**and**.

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| match: any    | Implicit OR, any conditional can be met            |
| match: all    | Implicit AND, all conditionals must be met         |

## Negative Conditions: Handling Inverse Logic

Sometimes you are looking for absences or other negative conditions in
command output. It's tempting to use the `neq` comparison for any
negative scenario, but it's not always the right choice. If you want the
inverse logic of `contains` (output from this command should not contain
this) consider using the **register** keyword to store the output
followed by a [when
statement](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#the-when-statement)
on a subsequent task. If you want to stop the playbook if conditions are
not met, consider simply using the [fail
module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/modules/fail_module.html)
or [assert
module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/assert_module.html)
where you can fail on purpose. The `neq` shown above only makes sense if
you can grab an exact value (if you can get key-value pairs or JSON)
versus getting a string or list of strings. Otherwise you are going to
be doing exact string compares.

## Going Further

Read the documentation on Working with Command Output in Network Modules
[here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/network_working_with_command_output.html).  

The more specific conditionals like ge, le, etc. can work really well on
JSON output from certain networking platforms as shown in the example in
the documentation.
