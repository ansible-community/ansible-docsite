# The Automation Experience, AnsibleFest 2022

It is almost time for our favorite event of the year! AnsibleFest is
back as an in-person event, and it's the only place to feel the full
power of automation. [Join us](http://ansiblefest.com/) October 18 and 19 in Chicago, and immerse
yourself in the movement that's made Ansible an industry-leading
automation technology.

The AnsibleFest 2022 session catalog and agenda builder are now
available. That means you can see all this year's session content and
build your own custom experience. Let's take a closer look at all that
AnsibleFest 2022 has to offer.

## Breakout Sessions

This year we will be featuring six content tracks. These tracks
include: Getting Started with Automation, the Ansible Community,
Automation Applied, Ansible Automation Platform, Advanced Ansible, and
Automation Adoption. Sessions across these tracks will cover a range of
focus areas, including network automation, security automation,
automation at the edge, IT leaders, developers, and several more. We
also have a wide range of customer, partner, and Ansible contributor
talks to join. You can see a list of all the sessions being offered in
our [session catalog](https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/rhaf22/SessionCatalog2022?tab.day=20221018).

## Workshops and Labs

Get hands-on experience at AnsibleFest in our workshops and labs. We
will have a mixture of self-paced and instructor led workshops for our
attendees. Topics range from Ansible 101 and writing your first playbook
to Terraforming with Ansible and Ansible 301. With over 20 labs and
workshops available, there is something for every level of automation
user to explore. See how AnsibleFest can help build your automation
skills by checking out all the hands-on content we will be offering in
the [session catalog](https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/rhaf22/SessionCatalog2022?tab.day=20221018).

## Spotlight Sessions

In Chicago, we're introducing a new session segment, Spotlight Stage.
These sessions will be 15 minute lightning talks and demos from key
Ansible customers and partners, with an interactive component where the
speakers will answer questions from the audience. The Spotlight Stage
will be attached directly to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
booth in the expo hall for easy access for all
attendees.

## Communities of Practice

The Communities of Practice are a new set of open forums in the
AnsibleFest Hallway Track for this year's AnsibleFest. These are 30
minute open forums led by Ansible experts in a set of diverse topics.
The audience will drive the discussion on
these topics based on what they want to learn from the experts. We will
be covering topics that include automation community + enthusiasm,
network automation, Ansible Automation Platform, automation at the edge,
security automation, event-driven automation, and cloud
automation.Â 

## Ask the Expert

As AnsibleFest returns in-person, we're excited to bring back the Ask
the Expert area. Here, you can get one-on-one time with Ansible experts
to ask any burning questions about automation. We will now feature a
larger space with designated areas for each expert's individual
expertise, helping ensure you can find the right person for your
questions. Experts will cover a wide range of topics that include
product components and features, migrations, as well as use
case-specific topics, like edge, network and event-driven
automation.
