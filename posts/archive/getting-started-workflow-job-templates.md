# Getting Started with Workflow Job Templates

Welcome to another post in the Getting Started series! Today we're going to get
into the topic of Workflow Job Templates. If you don't know what regular
Job Templates are in Red Hat Ansible Tower, please read the previously
published article that describes them. It'll provide you with some technical
details that'll be a useful jumping-off point for the topic of workflows.

Once you're familiar with the basics, read on! We'll be covering what
exactly Workflow Job Templates are, what makes them useful, how to
generate/edit one, and a few extra pointers as well as best practices to
make the most out of this great tool.

## What is a Workflow Job Template?

The word "workflow" says it all. This particular feature in Ansible
Tower (available as of version 3.1) enables users to create sequences
consisting of any combination of job templates, project syncs, and
inventory syncs that are linked together in order to execute them as a
single unit. Because of this, workflows can help you organize playbooks
and job templates into separate groups.

## Why are Workflows Useful?

By utilizing this feature, you can set up ordered structures for
different teams to use. For example, two different environments (i.e.,
networking and developers) can interface via workflows as long as they
have permissions to access it. Not everyone involved will need to know
what job run goes after what, since the structure is set up for them by
the user who created the workflow. This connects disparate job types and
unifies projects without each team needing to know everything about what
the other does.

Another reason workflows are useful is because they allow the user to
take any number of playbooks and "daisy chain" them, with the ability to
make a decision tree depending on a job's success or failure. You can
make them as simple or as complex as they need to be!

### How Do You Create One?

[Go into the Templates section on the top menu of Ansible Tower:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-13](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-13.jpg)

From there, click on "Add", but make sure to select "Workflow Template":

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-15](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-15.jpg)

You'll see this new screen, where you can name your workflow template
anything you like and save it:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-10](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-10.jpg)

Once you've done that, go into "Edit Workflow":

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-1](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-1.jpg)

This screen will come up, where you can add different job templates and
make sure they run on failure, success, or with either outcome:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-11](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-11.jpg)

Note that you can decide if things run on success, on failure, or
always.

[**![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-9](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-9.jpg)

As mentioned in the previous section, you can make your Ansible workflow
as simple...

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-4](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-4.jpg)

...or complex as you need to!

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-12](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-12.jpg)

After everything is set and saved, you're ready to launch your template,
which you can do by clicking on the rocket icon next to the workflow
you'd like to run:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-7](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-7.jpg)

### What More Can You Do With Workflows?

You can [schedule your workflows](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/workflow_templates.html#scheduling)
to run when you need them to! Just click on the calendar icon next to
any workflow job template:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-5](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-5.jpg)

... and fill out the information for when you want the specified
workflow to automatically run:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-8](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-8.jpg)
Â 
If you have a workflow template created that works very well for you and
you'd like to copy it, click on the button highlighted below:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-2](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-2.jpg)

Keep in mind that copying a workflow won't also copy over any of the
permissions, notifications, or schedules associated with the original.

If you need to set extra variables for the playbooks involved in a
workflow template and/or allow for authorization of user input, then
[setting up surveys](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/workflow_templates.html#surveys)
is the way to go. In order to set one up, select a workflow template and
click on the "Add Survey" button:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-3](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-3.jpg)

A survey screen that you can fill out with specific questions and answer
types will show up:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-14](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-14.jpg)

[Notifications](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/workflow_templates.html#work-with-notifications)
can give you more control and knowledge related to specific workflows.
To activate one, select the workflow that you want to set notifications
for, then click the Notifications button:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-16](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-16.jpg)

Keep in mind that you'll have to already have some notifications set up
in the Notifications list. The screen that comes up will enable you to
select specific notifications; in the example below the
"Workflow-Specific Notification" has been set to activate on either a
successful or failed run:

![Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-6](/images/posts/archive/Getting-Started-Tower-Workflows-6.jpg)

Note: Make sure you have "update on launch" on your inventory
selected when you make a new workflow job template if you're acting
against a dynamic
inventory!

### Conclusion

Now you know how to combine any number of playbooks into a customized
decision tree, with the ability to schedule those jobs, add
notifications, and much more. An added bonus is the fact that this isn't
an enterprise-only feature, so no matter your Ansible Tower license
type, you can log into your instance and have fun creating workflows!

I hope this article was helpful, and that it enables you to take
advantage of the powerful automation features that are possible with
Ansible Tower!
