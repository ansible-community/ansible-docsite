# Learn about Event-Driven Ansible at Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest 2023

As you may have heard,
[AnsibleFest](https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum23/SessionCatalog2023?tab.day=20230524&search.track=16439120758070013sVo)
will be taking place at Red Hat Summit in Boston May 23-25. This change
will allow you to harness everything that Red Hat technology has to
offer in a single place and give you even more tools to address your
automation needs. Join Ansible and automation-focused audiences to hear
from Red Hat and Ansible leaders, customers, and partners while getting
the latest on future Ansible product updates, community projects, and
what's coming in IT automation. 

Event-Driven Ansible is a key component to address the complexities of
managing varying assets at scale. We announced this product feature as a
developer preview last October at AnsibleFest 2022, and we are excited
to talk even more about it.  So what can you expect to see about
Event-Driven Ansible at AnsibleFest and Red Hat Summit this year? 

-   Red Hat Summit keynote with a customer story around their use of
    Event-Driven automation
-   AnsibleFest keynote about why the next wave of automation will be
    event-driven 
-   Breakout sessions from Ansible experts and customers
-   Hands on labs
-   Discovery Theater mini sessions in the expo hall

AnsibleFest and take advantage of the experts at the Ansible booth as
