first hand what our customers are using and how they need to integrate
Ansible Tower. There has always been a way to integrate the Ansible
Tower and Jenkins using [tower-cli](https://github.com/ansible/tower-cli), but
I thought there could be a neater, closer to native, way of doing it.

So here we go. I'veÂ recorded this short screencast to show you just how easy it is:
