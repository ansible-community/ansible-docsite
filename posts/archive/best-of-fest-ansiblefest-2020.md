# Best of AnsibleFest 2020

Thank you to everyone who joined us over the past two days for the
AnsibleFest 2020 virtual experience. We had such a great time connecting
with Ansible lovers across the globe. In case you missed some of it (or
all of it), we have some event highlights to share with you! If you want
to go see what you may have missed, all the AnsibleFest 2020 content
will be [available on demand](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=0D7D869A-8D51-4DED-9E1B-6699B9D36B9C)
for a year. 


## Community Updates

This year at AnsibleFest 2020, Ansible Community Architect Robyn
Bergeron kicked off with her keynote on Tuesday morning. We heard how
with Ansible Content Collections, it's easier than ever to use Ansible
the way you want or need to, as a contributor or an end user. Ansible
2.10 is now available, and Robyn explained how the feedback loop got us
there. If you want to hear more about the Ansible community project, go
watch Robyn's keynote [on demand](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=0D7D869A-8D51-4DED-9E1B-6699B9D36B9C). 

### Product Updates

Ansible's own Richard Henshall talked about the Red Hat Ansible
Automation Platform product updates and new releases. In 2018, we
unveiled the Ansible certified partner program and now we have over 50
platforms certified. We are bridging traditional platforms, containers
and edge with a new integration between Red Hat Advanced Cluster
Management for Kubernetes and Ansible Automation Platform. Learn more
about the new integration from our [press release](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-expands-automation-hybrid-clouds-red-hat-ansible-automation-platform-integration-red-hat-openshift-environments).
This year at AnsibleFest, we also introduced private Automation Hub,
where users can now manage and curate Ansible content privately, from
trusted sources. You can learn more about this and other Ansible
Automation Platform updates from our [press release](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-accelerates-hybrid-cloud-automation-catalog-ready-use-certified-and-supported-ansible-automation).
You can also listen to Richard's full keynote in the AnsibleFest
platform [on demand now](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=0D7D869A-8D51-4DED-9E1B-6699B9D36B9C).

### Channel Content

AnsibleFest 2020 showcased six channels of content; with something for
everyone. Some popular talks included the Ansible Automation Platform
Roadmap, Managing your own Private Ansible Content, Ansible Automation
Platform Technical Content Strategy, How to manage your Ansible
automation and how your automation is performing with analytics, and
much more! All 70+ breakout sessions are available on demand now.

We hope everyone enjoyed our first virtual AnsibleFest. Thank you to all
our attendees who helped make AnsibleFest 2020 the largest and most
successful AnsibleFest to date. To see more highlights of the event, you

happy automating!
