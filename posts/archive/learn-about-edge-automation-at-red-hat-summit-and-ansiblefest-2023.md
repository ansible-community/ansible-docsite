# Learn about Edge Automation at Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest 2023

As you may have heard,
[AnsibleFest](https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum23/SessionCatalog2023?tab.day=20230524&search.track=16439120758070013sVo)
will be taking place at Red Hat Summit in Boston May 23-25. This change
will allow you to harness everything that Red Hat technology has to
offer in a single place and will give you even more tools to address
your automation needs. Join Ansible and automation-focused audiences to
hear from Red Hat and Ansible leaders, customers, and partners while
getting the latest on the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform product
roadmap, community projects, and what's coming in IT
automation.

Across every industry, automation at the
edge is enabling emerging use cases by helping
organizations drive the next wave of
innovation as they explore and execute digital transformation
initiatives. Organizations are looking to extend a consistent automation
experience across cloud, datacenter, and edge with the ability to scale
in heterogeneous environments. Red Hat Ansible provides a common
platform where organizations can build, run, and manage the entirety of
their highly distributed systems, even to remote locations where network
connectivity may be intermittent.

Because we understand how important edge automation is to teams looking
to automate their entire IT landscape with a single platform, we have
lined up some great sessions at AnsibleFest and Red Hat
