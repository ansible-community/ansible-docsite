## Governance

The Ansible Community website is the landing page for all Ansible users and
contributors. It represents the first thing a new user will see, a signposting
resource for returning learners, and a content source for those who want to
know more. As such, it is important that the website be maintained with care.

The Website Working Group is tasked with this responsibility, and it uses the
following governance (using keywords as defined in [RFC
2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119)

---
- The Website Working Group (WWG) SHALL manage the Ansible Community website.
- The WWG SHALL ensure their own succession over time by promoting the most
  effective Contributors.
- The WWG SHOULD remove Members who are inactive for an extended period of
  time, or who repeatedly fail to apply this process accurately.
---
- A patch SHOULD have a minimum of 2 reviews from Members before it is merged.
- Members SHOULD NOT review/merge their own patches except in exceptional
  cases.
- Written content SHOULD be checked for accuracy at the time of writing.
- Visual changes SHOULD be deployed to a test site to ensure the change works
  as intended.
---
- All Contributions MUST be done using the GitHub PR process.
- Any Contributor MAY submit any patches they feel are suitable for inclusion.
- Any Contributor MAY review the patches of other Contributors. 
- Any Contributor who makes correct patches, writes good reviews, who clearly
  understands the project goals, and the process SHOULD be invited to become a
  Member of the WWG.
